# Welcome
FOSS Cell at MEC aims at bringing out new coding talents and open source enthusiasts to come forward and contribute to the Open Source and to bring back the FOSS culture at MEC. The club is inspired by FOSSMeet held at MEC 7 years ago in 2010. Also it aims in promoting FOSS culture at the college level so as to make students aware of the changing trends in science and technology and to equip students to cope up with highly demanding jobs. One of the main motives of FOSS MEC is to introduce and train people in the field of open source make people

### Objectives
* To nurture your coding talents 
* To give exposure in the open source community
* To incorporate the concepts of open source into other fields such as IoT
* To make you attain professional skills in the field of Computer Science for better job prospects.



### Completely new to Open Source? Keep READING!

Open-source software (OSS) is computer software with its source code made available with a license in which the copyright holder provides the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. Open-source software may be developed in a collaborative public manner. According to scientists who studied it, open-source software is a prominent example of open collaboration. You can take software and change it according to your own wish.

## No one teaches you how to become a developer in college, they teach you programming languages but companies wants developers. So how are people selected by big corporations 

## "Okay! Sounds Cool but I'm a complete begi..

#### ...beginner, how would I be able to cope up with being a software developer? Isn't it too difficult? Can I handle something like that?" 
This is the exact mindset you should get rid of! The thing is its not that difficult and FOSS is not all about programming. There are other things except programming to do in FOSS related projects. Like writing documentation, if you're a very good content writer then you could write manuals on how to use projects and stuff. And the developing part, its not that difficult at all! There are a lots of people to help you if you get stuck. 

## Sounds Cool! Okay, I'm ready to get into FOSS! What do I do?

Okay, So I guess you alread joined https://fosscellmec.slack.com ? If not go to the Whatsapp group and tell them to add you in!
Let's explain slack, slack is a platform for collaborating with other people like you. You could give suggestions, ask programming questions and work on projects by asking help from people and know about ongoings. 

#### I suggest you check in on slack everyday to make sure you don't miss out on anything.

On the right hand side of slack, there are streams, it's exactly like different groups on whatsapp. Suppose you are learning C/C++, you ask all your questions and contact people specifically learning C/C++.
On the general chat, there are everything from things happening on colleges and you can have general discussion there.
There's also the slack android app, go to the playstore and install it!!!!!

The important thing to note is that, you do not become a software developer overnight, it takes weeks and months of patience 
and perseverence, it might be hard at first, then it gets interesting the more you get into it. So Don't give up!

### Task 1: So your current task is to say Hi in the general stream in slack and check in everyday.

#### Okay, so that's done, now what?

# LINUX
### This part is for people who are unfamiliar with LINUX commands, if you have basic knowledge of Linux and know how to get around the system, feel free to skip this part. 

Basically there is no Open Source without linux, for becoming a developer the prime skills for you is using the command line, 
that is the black box you type commands in. You can develop using windows too but it is most useful to have a Linux based system. Learn basic Linux Commands from here before proceeding.

Feel free to follow any of the course here.

# GIT and GITHUB

GitHub is where people build software. More than 21 million people use GitHub to discover, fork, and contribute to over 56 million projects. The social network for programmer!!!!!!

Now lets get into something technical, the website you're reading this on is GitHub. You ask what is github? Official statement is that "GitHub is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project"

So now lets put into simple words, Github is a platform similar to Google Drive, but instead of photos and stuff you upload your Software projects here, if you're developing a Operating System or Website you upload the Source Code here, for safekeeping and file sharing. You can build the same software from people all over the world with GitHub.

So your first step into becoming a software developer is to learn git and learning to use github. 

Wisdom can be shared, we can only guide you on where to learn, it is your duty to learn. We will provide you with a list of resources to learn to get into git. And I again say NEVER GIVE UP!!!!!!

Here is a list of to learn GIT!

## Congratulations on getting this far!!! Now comes the real fun. Doing actual projects.


Actual projects can be classified into many, there are loads of Open Source Projects on all fields and all languages, but we are making a list of projects which are most prominent and has the most oppertunities.

Now you can decide what kind of project interests you by going through variety of projects given below.
Before contributing to a project you have to learn to develop it by learning the languages used in developing the app.

# Choose Wisely!!!!!!!!!!!!


## Task 2: Your second task is to select a suitable technology that you will learn and pursue, that you have interest in and interested in contributing to FOSS. You should select a suitable field from below and let us know in our slack general form.



# 1. WEB BASED PROJECTS : Python, Ruby, HTML, CSS, Javascript, mySQL, 

Web based projects can be anything to a website like Facebook, youtube, github. Or something like our college website, our attendance viewer are all web based projects but are not open source. 

Web based projects has two parts Frontend and Backend, read more about it here, https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/film-games/whats-difference-front-end-back-end


## 1.1 Frontend

Frontend is basically what you see, the colors, the animations, the wonderful pictures, people with creativity basically does this. It is the most easy of all the projects and the scope and amount of projects for this are very high.

### Technologies needed: 


* ### HTML

  HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML stands for Hyper Text                        Markup     Language. HTML describes the structure of Web pages using markup.

## 1.2 BACKEND

When you're building a website, you always need a similar set of components: a way to handle user authentication (signing up, signing in, signing out), a management panel for your website, forms, a way to upload files, etc.

Luckily for you, other people long ago noticed that web developers face similar problems when building a new site, so they teamed up and created frameworks  that give you ready-made components to use.

### Technologies Needed

* ###Back-end Web development
Your website or dynamic web application is a sum of layers—structure, design and content, and functionality. The technology and programming that “power” a site—what your end user doesn’t see but what makes the site run—is called the back end. Consisting of the server, the database, and the server-side applications, it’s the behind-the-scenes functionality—the brain of a site. This is the ecosystem of the database manager and the back-end developer.

SQL
Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard computer language for relational database management and data manipulation. SQL is used to query, insert, update and modify data.

Major Web-Frameworks
When you're building a website, you always need a similar set of components: a way to handle user authentication (signing up, signing in, signing out), a management panel for your website, forms, a way to upload files, etc.

Luckily for you, other people long ago noticed that web developers face similar problems when building a new site, so they teamed up and created frameworks  that give you ready-made components to use.

Django 
           Django is a free and open source web application framework, written in Python.Instagram,National            Geographic,Mozilla, Pintrest are some websites which run on django.
           
Ruby on Rails
           Rails like Django is also a free and open source web application but written in Ruby.                                        Codecademy,twitter(old version),plated,github are some sites build over Rails.

# 3. Machine Learning : Python, R, SQL

Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can change when exposed to new data. The process of machine learning is similar to that of data mining.

# 4. Java

Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. There are lots of applications and websites that will not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day. Java is fast, secure, and reliable.

Java is a platform Independent: – Platform independent means java can run on any computer irrespective to the hardware and software dependency. Means Java does not depend on hardware means what type of processor , RAM etc.

# 5. Google Summer of Code || Google Code-In

Google Code-in is a contest to introduce pre-university students (ages 13-17) to open source software development. Since 2010, over 3200 students from 99 countries have completed work in the contest.

Because Google Code-in is often the first experience many students have with open source, the contest is designed to make it easy for students to jump right in. Open source organizations chosen by Google provide a list of tasks for students to work on during the seven week contest period. A unique part of the contest is that each task has mentors from the organization assigned should students have questions or need help along the way.

Open source organizations that have participated in a previous Google Code-in or Google Summer of Code program are eligible to apply to be mentor organizations for Google Code-in. Mentor organizations create hundreds of tasks for students to work on during the contest period and are responsible for assigning mentors to help students with questions and to review students’ work on the tasks.

Metabrainz Foundation - https://metabrainz.org/
Drupal - https://www.drupal.org/     etc...

Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on introducing students to open source software development. Students work on a 3 month programming project with an open source organization during their break from university.

Since its inception in 2005, the program has brought together 12,000+ student participants and 11,000 mentors from over 127 countries worldwide. Google Summer of Code has produced 30,000,000+ lines of code for 568 open source organizations. 
As a part of Google Summer of Code, student participants are paired with a mentor from the participating organizations, gaining exposure to real-world software development and techniques. Students have the opportunity to spend the break between their school semesters earning a stipend while working in areas related to their interests.

In turn, the participating organizations are able to identify and bring in new developers who implement new features and hopefully continue to contribute to open source even after the program is over. Most importantly, more code is created and released for the use and benefit of all.
