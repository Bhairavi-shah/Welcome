Open-source software (OSS) is computer software with its source code made available with a license in which the copyright holder provides the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. Open-source software may be developed in a collaborative public manner. According to scientists who studied it, open-source software is a prominent example of open collaboration. You can take software and change it according to your own wish.

# ...beginner, how would I be able to cope up with being a software developer? Isn't it too difficult? Can I handle something like that?" 
This is the exact mindset you should get rid of! The thing is its not that difficult and FOSS is not all about programming. There are other things except programming to do in FOSS related projects. Like writing documentation, if you're a very good content writer then you could write manuals on how to use projects and stuff. And the developing part, its not that difficult at all! There are a lots of people to help you if you get stuck.
