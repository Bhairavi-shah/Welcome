# Welcome
FOSS Cell at MEC aims at bringing out new coding talents and open source enthusiasts to come forward and contribute to the Open Source and to bring back the FOSS culture at MEC. The club is inspired by FOSSMeet held at MEC 7 years ago in 2010. Also it aims in promoting FOSS culture at the college level so as to make students aware of the changing trends in science and technology and to equip students to cope up with highly demanding jobs. One of the main motives of FOSS MEC is to introduce and train people in the field of open source make people

### Objectives
* To nurture your coding talents 
* To give exposure in the open source community
* To incorporate the concepts of open source into other fields such as IoT
* To make you attain professional skills in the field of Computer Science for better job prospects.



### Completely new to Open Source? Keep READING!

Open-source software (OSS) is computer software with its source code made available with a license in which the copyright holder provides the rights to study, change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose. Open-source software may be developed in a collaborative public manner. According to scientists who studied it, open-source software is a prominent example of open collaboration. You can take software and change it according to your own wish.



## "Okay! Sounds Cool but I'm a complete begi..

#### ...beginner, how would I be able to cope up with being a software developer? Isn't it too difficult? Can I handle something like that?" 
This is the exact mindset you should get rid of! The thing is its not that difficult and FOSS is not all about programming. There are other things except programming to do in FOSS related projects. Like writing documentation, if you're a very good content writer then you could write manuals on how to use projects and stuff. And the developing part, its not that difficult at all! There are a lots of people to help you if you get stuck. 

## Sounds Cool! Okay, I'm ready to get into FOSS! What do I do?

Okay, So I guess you alread joined https://fosscellmec.slack.com ? If not go to the Whatsapp group and tell them to add you in!
Let's explain slack, slack is a platform for collaborating with other people like you. You could give suggestions, ask programming questions and work on projects by asking help from people and know about ongoings. 

#### I suggest you check in on slack everyday to make sure you don't miss out on anything.

On the right hand side of slack, there are streams, it's exactly like different groups on whatsapp. Suppose you are learning C/C++, you ask all your questions and contact people specifically learning C/C++.
On the general chat, there are everything from things happening on colleges and you can have general discussion there.
There's also the slack android app, go to the playstore and install it!!!!!

The important thing to note is that, you do not become a software developer overnight, it takes weeks and months of patience 
and perseverence, it might be hard at first, then it gets interesting the more you get into it. So Don't give up!

### Task 1: So your current task is to say Hi in the general stream in slack and check in everyday.

#### Okay, so that's done, now what?

# LINUX
### This part is for people who are unfamiliar with LINUX commands, if you have basic knowledge of Linux and know how to get around the system, feel free to skip this part. 

Basically there is no Open Source without linux, for becoming a developer the prime skills for you is using the command line, 
that is the black box you type commands in. You can develop using windows too but it is most useful to have a Linux based system. Learn basic Linux Commands from here before proceeding.

Feel free to follow any of the course here.

# GIT and GITHUB

GitHub is where people build software. More than 21 million people use GitHub to discover, fork, and contribute to over 56 million projects. The social network for programmer!!!!!!

Now lets get into something technical, the website you're reading this on is GitHub. You ask what is github? Official statement is that "GitHub is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project"

So now lets put into simple words, Github is a platform similar to Google Drive, but instead of photos and stuff you upload your Software projects here, if you're developing a Operating System or Website you upload the Source Code here, for safekeeping and file sharing. You can build the same software from people all over the world with GitHub.

So your first step into becoming a software developer is to learn git and learning to use github. 

Wisdom can be shared, we can only guide you on where to learn, it is your duty to learn. We will provide you with a list of resources to learn to get into git. And I again say NEVER GIVE UP!!!!!!

Here is a list of to learn GIT!
